# Cipher Movies

## Goals

* Allow users to sign up and sign in (using the existing user model)
* After signing in, allow users to search the iTunes Store API for movies (only movies! not songs or apps!)
* Allow user to save a movie to their watch list

Bonus points if you have time:

* If a search returns no results, allow users to subscribe for notifications when those movies are available
* Deploy to Heroku
